React.JS

React JS is an open-source, component-based Javascript library, which is used to build UI
specifically for single-page applications. It’s one of the most popular Javascript libraries
used to build apps front-end right now. Facebook is an example of ReactJS and until today it 
has a huge community supporting it and lots of resources to learn it.

Javascript is a programming language used to create dynamic elements on the website or web app.
Almost all modern browsers support Javascript. Entering any webpage, it has lots of features 
written in Javascript, like form validation, advanced animations, popups, etc. Javascript is 
used to build web apps and pages with client-side scripting.

The Javascript library is a pre-written Javascript code that makes the development of apps easier 
and faster. It consists of ready components,functions, and patterns, which can be used to accomplish 
specific programming tasks. In many cases, it also helps to keep our applications more secure and
more efficient. Javascript frameworks are used to decrease the amount of coding and reduce the cost 
of app development, as libraries are mostly open-source and free.

As a result React.js is a library for building user interfaces. This is perfect because, more often than not, 
this is all we want. The best part about this description is that it highlights React’s simplicity. It’s
not a mega framework. It’s not a full-stack solution that’s going to handle everything from the database
to real-time updates over web socket connections. React.js is generally thought of as the view layer in an
application. React components change what the user sees such as UI elements and Handlebars templates.
